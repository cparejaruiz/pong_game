# Pong Game in Godot

Welcome to the Pong game repository, developed using the Godot engine following the Indierama tutorial. This project demonstrates how to create a simple and functional single-player Pong game in Godot, featuring a basic AI opponent.

## Description

Pong is a classic game that simulates a table tennis match in two dimensions. In this game, you play against an AI opponent. The goal is to score 10 points to win. You control a paddle that moves vertically to return the ball and prevent it from passing your side of the screen.

## Features

- Single-player mode against an AI opponent.
- Paddle movement controlled by the player.
- The ball dynamically bounces off the paddle and screen edges.
- The game ends when either player scores 10 points.
